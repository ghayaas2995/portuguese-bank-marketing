The classification goal is to predict if a bank customer will subscribe a term deposit related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution

The sample data contains 4521 observations and 17 variables which is a subset of a full marketing campaigning dataset containing over 45000 rows related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The campaign was carried out to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed as a result of repeated advertising by making phone calls to the customers.

Performed necessary data cleaning, data imputation, encoding of categorical variables and built a pipeline to evaluate various classification models and compare thier performance to choose the best model. The models tested as their results are below. Based on the nature of the dataset, it was observed that a decision tree algorithm classified the response variable in training with highest accuracy of 100% and a neighbours algorithm showed least classification performance.
